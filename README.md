# Appic DEX - Decentralized Exchange on ICP

## Overview

Appic DEX is a decentralized exchange built in Rust, deployed on the Internet Computer (ICP). It enables trustless, permission-less trading of tokens with features like automated market maker (AMM) pools, liquidity provision, and fee collection. This project leverages the scalability and security of ICP to provide a fast and cost-efficient trading experience.

## Features

- **Pool Creation and Management**: Create and manage AMM pools with customizable fees and initial price settings.
- **Token Swapping**: Perform single or multi-hop swaps with exact input or output amounts, supporting flexible trading paths.
- **Quoting**: Performs quoting for single or multi-hop swaps in both exact input or exact output directions.
- **Liquidity Management**: Add, increase, decrease, or burn liquidity positions with precise control over price ranges (ticks).
- **Fee Collection**: Collect accumulated fees from liquidity positions in both tokens of a pool.
- **Comprehensive Queries**: Access pool states,, historical data, user balances, and position details for transparency and analysis.
- **Security**: Built with Rust for memory safety and designed with robust error handling for reliable operation.

## Prerequisites

To run or develop this DEX, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust
- DFX (Internet Computer SDK, version 0.20.0 or later)
- Make (for simplified build and test process; see installation guide below)

## Installing Make

To use the `make build` and `make test` commands, install `make`:

### On macOS

```bash
brew install make
```

### On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install make
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
make --version
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Appic-Solutions/appic-dex.git
   cd appic-dex
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: Run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. **Start DFX**: Ensure DFX is running in the background:

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

4. **Deploy the DEX Canister**: Deploy the DEX canister using:

   ```bash
   dfx deploy appic_dex
   ```

5. **Interact with the DEX**: Use the Candid UI or a custom frontend to interact with the deployed canister. Access the canister ID from the deployment output.

## Testing

Run all tests (unit and integration) with:

```bash
make test
```
